Conway's Game of Life Implementation in Asp.net core console

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies from isolation.<br />
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.<br />
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies from overcrowding.<br />
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
